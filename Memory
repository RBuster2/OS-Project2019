 // Feel like I might be missing something, but the description of memory didn't really give me much to work with.
 // Says that this module is the only one by which RAM can be accessed. Also says that an address can be passed to it,
 and that it writes "datum" into RAM. Figured that could be done through the write method. Also couldn't remember if we
 discussed the data types for the registers, etc.
